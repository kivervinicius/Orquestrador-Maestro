# Orquestrador Maestro Benchmark — Methodology

## What this benchmark is for

This harness lets you compare an AI workflow with and without Maestro under the same scenario, model, and acceptance criteria. It is a reproducible method, not a leaderboard and not proof that one result applies to every model or project.

Use the [quick start](#quick-start) to run your own comparison. Read the [claims policy](#claims-policy) before publishing a number: the useful question is not “who wins forever?”, but “what happened under these recorded conditions?”

---

## 1. Purpose

The benchmark harness answers a single question: *When two agent harnesses run the same task on the same codebase with the same model, which one produces correct output more efficiently?*

Design principles:

- **Reproducibility.** A fresh clone, `npm ci`, and a single command should reproduce any reported result.
- **Honesty.** Results pass an evidence gate before the harness allows claims.
- **Isolation.** Each run operates in an ephemeral workspace; no state leaks between runs.
- **Transparency.** Raw evidence (stdout, stderr, NDJSON events, session data) is retained alongside processed metrics.

---

## 2. Validity Threats

The following factors can invalidate results if uncontrolled.

| Threat | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Model nondeterminism** | Same prompt produces different outputs across runs | Multiple runs per scenario; median-based comparison; significance testing (Mann-Whitney U, n ≥ 5) |
| **Provider API changes** | Model behavior shifts between benchmark dates | Pin model version in scenario config; record `MODEL` env var and commit hash |
| **Model aliases** | `claude-sonnet-4` resolves to different snapshots over time | Use full versioned model IDs (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`); record in result metadata |
| **Rate limiting** | Queued requests add latency that does not reflect model capability | Record `durationMs` separately from token metrics; flag runs where timeout was approached |
| **Prompt/runtime changes** | Harness updates alter what the agent sees | Pin prompt hash (`promptHash` field); lock benchmark version per report |
| **Network variation** | Round-trip time affects wall-clock duration | Container isolation with fixed resource limits; report duration as secondary metric |
| **Sample size** | Small n produces unstable estimates | Require n ≥ 5 for significance claims; report 95% confidence intervals |
| **Fixture representativeness** | Fixtures may not reflect real-world codebases | Use multi-file, realistic mini-projects; document fixture limitations explicitly |
| **Cache effects** | Prompt caching reduces token cost on repeat runs | Record `cachedTokens` separately; report cache hit rate |
| **Token accounting differences** | Providers count tokens differently | Hierarchical source attribution (§11); never mix sources in a single comparison |

---

## 3. Experimental Conditions

A paired benchmark command evaluates three conditions on identical task prompts. A single run can select one of them.

| Condition | Agent sees | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `vanilla` | Raw prompt only — no Maestro workflow, no `AGENTS.md`, no skill routing | Baseline: model performance without orchestration |
| `maestro` | Prompt prefixed with Maestro rules (observe → route → select → act → verify → report) | Workflow-augmented: model performance with structured orchestration |
| `maestro-focus` | Maestro workflow plus the focus interaction profile | A more constrained communication profile for comparison |

The `maestro` condition prepends the workflow guidance to the scenario task. The implementation is in `benchmark-harness/src/drivers/opencode.ts`.

```
You are working with the Orquestrador Maestro.

Rules:
- Use minimal sufficient context
- Verify results before declaring completion
- Do not commit without authorization

Flow: Observe → Route → Select → Act → Verify → Report

Task: <scenario prompt>
```

Both conditions use the same model, the same fixture codebase, and the same hidden tests. The only variable is the workflow preamble.

---

## 4. Isolation

Each benchmark run is isolated at three levels.

### 4.1 Workspace Isolation

The harness hashes the fixture and creates an ephemeral copy in the system temp folder (`benchmark-harness/src/fixtures/index.ts`, via `benchmark-harness/src/orchestrator/index.ts`):

```
/tmp/fixture-<timestamp>-<random>-<runId>/
```

The copy is committed with `git init+add+commit` for diffing.

The fixture is copied recursively. After the run completes (pass or fail), the workspace is deleted. No two runs share a workspace.

### 4.2 Container Isolation

Official runs can execute agent processes inside Docker containers with:

- No host network access (only the provider API endpoint)
- CPU limits (2 vCPU)
- Memory limits (4 GB)
- Ephemeral filesystem (no persistent volumes)
- Verifier runs in a separate container from the agent

Use `--container` for official runs. The container runner validates the required isolation metadata before an official claim is eligible.

### 4.3 Verifier Isolation

The hidden test runner (`benchmark-harness/src/verifier/index.ts`) executes the scenario command in the agent's workspace directory, with `CI=true` and `NO_COLOR=1` (default timeout 120s). It does not share state with the agent process. Pass means exit code 0; the verifier does not parse TAP output.

---

## 5. Agent Driver

### 5.1 OpenCode CLI Driver

Two drivers exist: `OpenCodeDriver` (`benchmark-harness/src/drivers/opencode.ts`, invoking the real `opencode` CLI) and `MaestroDriver` (`benchmark-harness/src/drivers/maestro.ts`, invoking `orquestrador-maestro benchmark run`).

It invokes the real `opencode` CLI — not a mock, not an API wrapper. This ensures measured token usage and behavior reflect the actual tool the user would experience.

The driver:

1. Checks availability via `which opencode`
2. Builds the prompt with the condition preamble
3. Invokes `opencode run <message> --format json --model <model> --dir <workDir> --auto`
4. Parses the last line of stdout as JSON to extract `usage`, `tools`, and `session` data
5. Returns a `DriverResult` with `success`, `usage`, `durationMs`, `tools`, `evidence`, and `stdout`

### 5.2 Driver Extensibility

Drivers live in `benchmark-harness/src/drivers/` (`opencode.ts`, `maestro.ts`; shared types in `benchmark-harness/src/types/`). To add a driver:

1. Implement the `AgentDriver` interface (`benchmark-harness/src/types/driver.ts`):
   - `get name()` — unique driver identifier
   - `async isAvailable()` — check if the driver can execute
   - `async execute(scenario, options)` — run the agent and return a `DriverResult`
2. Wire it into the CLI (`benchmark-harness/src/cli/index.ts`)

### 5.3 Evidence Metadata

Every driver must populate `evidence` on its result:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `executionType` | `"real-execution"` | Only real CLI invocations are valid |
| `reproducible` | `boolean` | Whether the same inputs produce comparable outputs |
| `isolated` | `boolean` | Whether the run was isolated from other runs |

---

## 6. Model Configuration

The model is specified via the `--model` CLI flag or the `MODEL` environment variable.

**Format:** `<provider>/<model-name>` (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)

**Reproducibility requirement:** Use a full versioned model ID. Alias names (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4`) may resolve to different snapshots over time and produce non-reproducible results.

The model string is recorded in every `RunResult` object and included in all reports.

### Supported Providers

Any provider supported by OpenCode CLI. The harness itself is provider-agnostic; it delegates to the CLI driver.

---

## 7. Fixtures

Fixtures are realistic mini-projects located under `benchmark-harness/fixtures/`. They are not toy examples.

### 7.1 Fixture Structure

Each fixture contains:

```
fixtures/<scenario-name>/
├── package.json              # Node.js project with test scripts
├── src/                      # Source code with the bug/feature/refactor target
│   └── <files>
└── test/
    ├── <visible-test>.js     # Tests the agent can see (part of acceptance criteria display)
    └── hidden.test.js        # Verification tests the agent cannot see
```

### 7.2 Current Fixtures

| Scenario | Fixture | Files | Complexity |
|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| `bug-fix-auth` | Token rotation bug in `TokenService.js` | 3 source + 2 test | Medium — security-critical single-file fix |
| `feature-add-button` | Extend `Button.js` with variants/sizes | 2 source + 2 test | Medium — UI component with CSS classes |
| `refactor-extract-util` | Extract duplicated date logic from `ReportService.js` | 3 source + 2 test | Medium — multi-file refactoring |
| `investigate-performance` | Analyze `dataService.js` for inefficiencies | 2 source + 2 test | Hard — open-ended investigation + fix |
| `resume-auth-feature` | Complete `AuthService.js` TODOs | 1 source + 2 test | Medium — feature completion from stubs |
| `cross-session-migration` | Complete `TaskStore.js` TODOs | 1 source + 2 test | Medium — feature completion with edge cases |

### 7.3 Fixture Integrity

Fixtures are deterministic. The harness records `promptHash` (SHA-256 of the prompt) and `repoCommit` (git HEAD at benchmark time) in every result. Any modification to a fixture changes the hash, making tampering detectable.

Protected files are defined by the scenario's `expectedInvariants` array. After execution, invariant checks verify that protected properties still hold.

---

## 8. Scenarios

Scenarios are defined as JSON files under `benchmark-harness/`.

### 8.1 Scenario Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `bug` | Fix a defect in existing code | `bug-fix-auth` — refresh token reuse |
| `feature` | Add new functionality | `feature-add-button` — component variants |
| `refactor` | Restructure without changing behavior | `refactor-extract-util` — extract shared utility |
| `investigation` | Analyze and document findings, then fix | `investigate-performance` — query patterns |
| `resume` | Complete partial implementation | `resume-auth-feature` — fill TODO stubs |
| `migration` | Cross-file structural change | `cross-session-migration` — task store migration |

### 8.2 Scenario Schema

Defined in `benchmark-harness/schemas/scenario.json` and validated in `benchmark-harness/src/scenarios/index.ts`:

```json
{
  "id": "kebab-case-unique-id",
  "name": "Human-readable name",
  "task": "Exact instructions sent to the agent",
  "fixture": { "path": "../fixtures/<directory-name>" },
  "acceptance": { "criteria": [{ "type": "hidden_tests", "name": "...", "command": "..." }] },
  "limits": {
    "maxTimeMs": 120000,
    "maxRetries": 1
  }
}
```

**Validation rules:**
- `id` must be kebab-case (`/^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$/`)
- `task` must be a non-empty string
- `fixture.path` must exist on disk
- `limits` is required

### 8.3 Adding a Scenario

1. Create a fixture directory under `benchmark-harness/fixtures/<your-scenario>/`
2. Populate it with realistic source code and a `package.json` with test scripts
3. Create `test/hidden.test.js` using Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`)
4. Create `benchmark-harness/scenarios/<your-scenario>.json` following the schema
5. Validate from the repository root with `npm run bench:validate`

### 8.4 Design Principles

- **Real code, not stubs.** Fixtures should be realistic enough that a model unfamiliar with the codebase would need to read and understand the source.
- **Hidden tests verify behavior, not implementation.** Tests assert outcomes (e.g., "old token is invalid") not internal state (e.g., "Set.delete was called").
- **Clear prompts.** Instructions should be unambiguous. If the agent needs to make design decisions, those decisions should be testable.
- **Acceptance criteria are observable.** Each criterion maps to a verifiable outcome.

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

Each scenario defines an `acceptance` array of human-readable criteria and a `validation` object with automated verification.

### 9.1 Hidden Tests

Hidden tests run via the scenario command (usually `node --test`, the Node.js built-in test runner). The verifier (`benchmark-harness/src/verifier/index.ts`) executes the test command in the agent's workspace directory; pass means exit code 0. Anti-gaming checks (`benchmark-harness/src/verifier/integrity.ts`) reject `.skip`/`.only` cheats in official runs.

### 9.2 Build Verification

When a fixture includes a build step (e.g., TypeScript compilation), the hidden test suite should include a build assertion. The agent is expected to produce code that compiles without errors.

### 9.3 Type Checking

For TypeScript fixtures, hidden tests should include `tsc --noEmit` or equivalent. This is scenario-specific and not enforced globally.

### 9.4 Linting

For fixtures with ESLint or similar, hidden tests may include lint assertions. This is scenario-specific.

<a id="evidence-gate"></a>

### 9.5 Evidence Gate

A run passes the evidence gate when all of the following are true
(`isClaimEligibleRun` in `benchmark-harness/src/evidence/index.ts`):

1. **Pipeline assertion** — `evidence.publicClaimEligible === true` (set by the
   orchestrator only when validation passed, tokens are provider-reported,
   inputs are reproducible and the run was isolated).
2. **Real execution** — `evidence.executionType === "real-execution"`
   (dry-runs never produce reports).
3. **Container provenance** — containerized runs are accepted only with
   daemon-anchored provenance: both `environment.containerImage` and
   `environment.containerId` must be present. `containerId` is issued by the
   container runtime, so a bare `container:true` flag or a user-typed image
   alone is not enough. Additionally, `evidence.isolated` must be consistent
   with containment (`isolated === (container === true)`): a non-container
   run claiming `isolated:true` is rejected as forged. Local
   (non-container) runs are therefore never claim-eligible — official claims
   require `--container`.
4. **Provider-reported tokens** — `tokenSource === "provider-reported"`
   (estimated or unavailable token counts are rejected).
5. **Reproducibility** — `evidence.reproducible === true` (scenario, fixture
   and task hashes recorded).
6. **Isolation** — `evidence.isolated === true`.
7. **Validation passed** — `validation.passed === true` (hidden acceptance suite).

Runs that fail the evidence gate are flagged with `publicClaimEligible: false`.
`evidence.reproducible`/`isolated`/`executionType` are written by the
orchestrator into `run-report.json`; the gate re-validates them independently.

---

## 10. Evidence

Evidence is the raw and processed data that supports benchmark claims.

### 10.1 Raw Evidence

Each `RunResult` contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `driverResult.stdout` | Last 5,000 characters of agent stdout |
| `driverResult.usage` | Token counts (input, output, cached, reasoning, total) |
| `driverResult.tools` | Tool usage statistics (calls, files read/modified/created/deleted) |
| `driverResult.session` | Session metadata from the agent driver |
| `validation.output` | Last 2,000 characters of test output |
| `environment` | OS, Node version, platform, architecture, timestamp |
| `promptHash` | SHA-256 of the exact prompt sent to the agent |
| `repoCommit` | Git HEAD hash at benchmark time |

### 10.2 Normalized Evidence

Processed metrics derived from raw evidence:

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `tokensToSuccess` | `driverResult.usage.totalTokens` for runs passing the evidence gate |
| `retryTax` | Token cost of failed attempts before a successful run |
| `durationMs` | Wall-clock time from agent start to completion |
| `tools.calls` | Total tool invocations by the agent |

### 10.3 Immutability

Evidence is written to disk immediately after each run (`benchmark-harness/src/orchestrator/index.ts:280`) and never modified. Results are saved as:

```
evidence/<benchmark>_<condition>_run<N>.json
```

### 10.4 Sanitization

Before publication, evidence must be sanitized:
- Remove API keys, tokens, and credentials from stdout/stderr
- Remove file paths containing usernames or home directories
- Redact any PII found in agent output

---

## 11. Token Accounting

Token counting is the most contested metric in AI benchmarks. This harness uses a hierarchical source attribution system.

### 11.1 Source Hierarchy

| Priority | Source | Trust | Description |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `provider-reported` | High | Direct from API response (`usage` field) |
| 2 | `tokenizer-exact` | Medium | Local tokenization with provider's tokenizer |
| 3 | `tokenizer-estimated` | Low | Approximate tokenization (e.g., tiktoken for non-OpenAI models) |
| 4 | `not-applicable` | — | No token data available (e.g., mock/dry runs) |
| 5 | `unknown` | None | Source unspecified |

The `tokenSource` field on `TokenUsage` (`benchmark-harness/src/types/tokens.ts:42`) records which source was used.

### 11.2 Reconciliation

When provider-reported and tokenizer-estimated values diverge by more than 15%, the result is flagged with a `measurementAnomaly` note in metadata. This typically indicates:

- Provider uses a non-standard tokenizer
- Prompt caching is active but not reflected in the estimate
- The model counts reasoning tokens differently

### 11.3 Cache Awareness

Token usage distinguishes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `inputTokens` | Tokens in the prompt sent to the model |
| `outputTokens` | Tokens generated by the model |
| `cachedTokens` | Input tokens served from cache (reduced cost) |
| `reasoningTokens` | Tokens used for chain-of-thought (model-dependent) |
| `totalTokens` | Sum of input + output (provider-specific formula) |

Cache hit rate is reported alongside token metrics: `cachedTokens / inputTokens`.

---

## 12. Metrics

### 12.1 Primary Metric: tokensToSuccess

The total tokens consumed in runs that passed the evidence gate. This is the primary comparison metric because it captures both the efficiency of the harness (fewer tokens needed) and the correctness of the output (only successful runs count).

### 12.2 Retry Tax

Tokens consumed on failed attempts before the first success. High retry tax indicates the harness or model struggles with the task, requiring multiple attempts.

### 12.3 Statistical Functions

Implemented in `benchmark-harness/src/metrics/statistics.ts`:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `median(arr)` | Middle value of sorted array |
| `percentile(arr, p)` | Value at percentile p (0–100) |
| `mean(arr)` | Arithmetic average |
| `stddev(arr)` | Sample standard deviation (Bessel's correction) |
| `confidenceInterval95(arr)` | 95% CI half-width using z = 1.96 |
| `aggregateResults(results)` | Combined statistics for a set of runs |
| `compareConditions(vanilla, maestro)` | Side-by-side comparison with deltas |

### 12.4 Aggregated Output

`aggregateResults()` returns:

```json
{
  "n": 5,
  "successRate": 0.8,
  "tokens": {
    "median": 12500,
    "mean": 13200,
    "p50": 12500,
    "p95": 18000,
    "min": 9800,
    "max": 18000,
    "ci95": { "lower": 10100, "upper": 16300 },
    "stddev": 3200
  },
  "duration": {
    "median": 45000,
    "mean": 47000,
    "p50": 45000,
    "p95": 62000,
    "min": 38000,
    "max": 62000,
    "ci95": { "lower": 39000, "upper": 55000 },
    "stddev": 8500
  }
}
```

### 12.5 Significance Testing

For n ≥ 5 per condition, the harness supports Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric comparison of token distributions. This is appropriate because token counts are typically non-normal.

For n < 5, results are reported as "directional" with a note: "Insufficient runs for statistical significance (need >=3 per condition)."

### 12.6 Outlier Detection

Outliers are identified using the IQR method:
- Q1 = 25th percentile, Q3 = 75th percentile
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Outlier threshold: values below Q1 - 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR

Outliers are flagged in reports but not excluded from calculations.

---

## 13. Anti-Gaming

The harness includes multiple mechanisms to prevent agents from optimizing for visible criteria rather than actual correctness.

### 13.1 Hidden Tests

Agents cannot see `test/hidden.test.js`. The scenario definition references the file path, but the agent's prompt does not include the test contents. This prevents agents from writing code that satisfies the test harness without actually solving the problem.

### 13.2 Test Integrity Checking

Hidden tests are loaded from the fixture directory and executed against the agent's modified code. If an agent modifies the test file itself, the test will likely fail because it no longer tests the intended behavior.

### 13.3 Fixture Tampering Detection

The harness records `promptHash` (SHA-256 of the prompt) and `repoCommit` (git HEAD). If fixtures are modified between the benchmark setup and execution, the commit hash will not match the expected baseline.

### 13.4 Protected File Hash Verification (Planned)

Future versions will compute SHA-256 hashes of protected fixture files before and after execution. Files not expected to change (e.g., `test/hidden.test.js`, `package.json`) will be verified for integrity.

### 13.5 Gaming Pattern Detection (Planned)

Planned heuristics to detect gaming:
- Agent modifies hidden test files
- Agent creates mock implementations that pass tests but are not real solutions
- Agent deletes the entire codebase and recreates from scratch

<a id="claims-policy"></a>

## 14. Claims Policy

This section defines what can and cannot be claimed based on benchmark results.

### 14.1 Permitted Claims

A claim must reference all of the following:

- Benchmark version (e.g., `v2.3.0`)
- Dataset (e.g., "6 scenarios, 5 runs each")
- Model and version (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Sample size (e.g., `n = 30`)
- Date of execution
- Repository commit hash

**Example of a permitted claim:**

> "In the v2.3.0 benchmark suite (6 scenarios, 5 runs each, n = 30), on model `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, Maestro reduced median tokens-to-success by 23% compared to vanilla, with 95% CI [18%, 28%]. Executed 2026-09-01, commit `abc1234`."

### 14.2 Prohibited Claims

- "Maestro always uses 30% fewer tokens" — absolute claims without dataset/model/version qualification
- "Maestro is faster" — unqualified speed claims without duration data
- "Maestro has no bugs" — false; benchmarks measure specific scenarios
- Claims based on `synthetic` or `infrastructure` evidence types
- Claims based on tokenizer-estimated data without provider-reported validation

### 14.3 Marketing Guidelines

| Claim Type | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Quantitative ("X% fewer tokens") | Provider-reported data, sample size, CI, baseline, timestamp |
| Qualitative ("Maestro organizes context") | Must be verifiable, must not exaggerate, must reflect actual behavior |
| Feature claims ("Maestro supports episodic memory") | Must be demonstrable in the product |

---

## 15. Reproducibility

<a id="quick-start"></a>

### 15.1 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IAPro-Community/Orquestrador-Maestro.git
cd Orquestrador-Maestro
cd benchmark-harness
npm ci
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts preflight --scenario scenarios/bug-fix-auth.json
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts pair --scenario scenarios/bug-fix-auth.json --container
```

### 15.2 What's Fixed

| Parameter | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Model version | `--model` flag with full versioned ID |
| Prompt text | Stored in scenario JSON; hash recorded per run |
| Fixture code | Deterministic files in `_fixtures/`; commit tracked |
| Harness version | `package.json` version + git commit |
| Test expectations | `hidden.test.js` in fixture directory |
| Execution environment | OS, Node version, platform, architecture recorded |

### 15.3 What Varies

| Parameter | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Network latency | Affects `durationMs` only, not token counts |
| Provider load | May affect response time; mitigated by multiple runs |
| Model nondeterminism | Mitigated by median-based comparison with CI |

---

## 16. CI Integration

### 16.1 PR Validation

On every pull request, the CI pipeline runs:

```bash
npm run bench:validate          # Schema validation for all scenarios
npm run bench:test              # Unit tests for harness code
docker build -t bench-harness benchmark-harness/docker # Verify the benchmark image
```

This ensures scenarios are well-formed and harness code is correct before merge.

### 16.2 Official Benchmark

Scheduled runs (weekly or on-demand) execute the full suite:

```bash
npm run bench:pair -- \
  --scenario benchmark-harness/scenarios/bug-fix-auth.json \
  --container \
  --evidence evidence
```

Results are stored as artifacts and compared against previous runs for regression detection.

### 16.3 CI Benchmark (Free Model)

A lightweight CI benchmark uses a free-tier model to verify harness correctness without incurring API costs:

```bash
npm run bench:run -- \
  --scenario benchmark-harness/scenarios/bug-fix-auth.json \
  --condition vanilla
```

This catches harness regressions (broken fixtures, schema changes) without burning budget.

### 16.4 npm Scripts

| Script | Command |
|--------|---------|
| `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts list` | List available scenarios |
| `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts validate` | Validate scenario definitions |
| `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts run` | Run one condition |
| `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts pair` | Run the three-condition comparison |
| `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts --help` | Show CLI help |

## Adaptive Resolution hard-evidence condition

The benchmark harness reserves `maestro-adaptive` for the policy-bound Adaptive Resolution treatment. It is not an alias for `maestro-focus`.

A matched hard-evidence pair uses the same scenario, fixture, model, driver family, and generated `pairId` for control `maestro` and treatment `maestro-adaptive`.

Run through the top-level Maestro CLI so the runtime injects the canonical policy identity:

```bash
orquestrador-maestro benchmark adaptive-pair \
  --scenario <scenario> \
  --model <model>
```

The Maestro driver executes the real `go --auto` path. Adaptive confirmation and mission-usage markers are authenticated with a per-run nonce that is stripped from provider subprocess environments. Missing or mismatched confirmation is a `benchmark-integrity-violation`.

Mission token totals are accepted only when every provider invocation in the Maestro process exposes complete fresh-session provider usage. Any incomplete or resumed invocation makes the end-to-end total unavailable rather than estimated. The evidence gate independently requires provider-reported tokens, external validation, reproducible inputs, container provenance, and isolation before a run can support a public efficiency claim.

The dedicated adaptive command runs only the two conditions needed by the promotion dataset. Local runs remain analysis-only. Official promotion evidence requires container execution with daemon-issued container provenance; the checked-out Maestro runtime commit is recorded in the run report.
